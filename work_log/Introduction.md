# Introduction

This is my project log, which is updated regularly to document my progress, thoughts, and reflections throughout the duration of my project. It serves as a personal journal where I can track my journey, challenges faced, solutions implemented, and insights gained.

It also pulls in my progress and goals from the shared Google Doc that I have with my supervisor, acting as a bridge between my personal reflections and the collaborative aspects of my project.
